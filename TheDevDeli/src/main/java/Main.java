        customize their sandwich orders. ***

    * Customers can order a sandwich in 3 sizes: 4", 8" and 12"
    *
    * When they order, they choose the type of bread (white, wheat, rye, or wrap)
    *
    * Then a customer can choose their toppings.
    * Toppings are categorized as regular or premium.
    * Premium Toppings: Meats and Cheeses.
    * Regular Toppings: most other toppings that aren't meats or cheeses.

    * chips or a drink).
    * Verify with the customer that the order is correct.
